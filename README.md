Hello! Thanks for finding out the repo for my latest portfolio website. This website is not just my new portfolio, but also a private project in and of itself. i feel I've grown quite bit as a developer & designer within the past year, so I wanted to make something to showcase a number of what I've learned and done.

## What I used
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) for coding
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) for easy push-to-deploy hosting
